        <p>What is CSS?</p>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to
           simplify the process of making web pages presentable.</p>
        <p>CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the
           text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out,
           what background images or colors are used, as well as a variety of other effects.</p>
        <p>CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an
           HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or
           XHTML</p>
