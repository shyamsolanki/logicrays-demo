        <h1>Background Image</h1>
    <p>It is really very charming to enjoy the scene of a sun set in a cloudless sky in Bangladesh. It marks the end of the day . The sun goes down and sheds its mild rays from the western sky. It looks like a dish of gold . We find a brilliant show of colors in the western sky . Seven colors make the western sky look charming . The whole earth and the sky seem to be painted with colors .</p><p> The golden rays of the setting sun fall on the water of ponds , rivers , on top of trees . The western horizon appears exquisitely beautiful . The sky is then covered with the red glow of the setting sun and all the objects of nature put on a charming appearance. The ripples of the rivers look purple in the red glow of the departing sun.</p><p>Gradually the sun sinks down below the horizon and the red tinge of the sky begins to fade away . Darkness  then covers the whole earth. The cowboys return home with their cattle. Birds are seen flying back to their nests . Nothing but a few stars are seen in the western sky . A sun set scene in really enjoyable.</p>
